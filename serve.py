    #     An app that aims to enhance spatial navigation for visually impaired individuals by developing an intelligent AI-driven system that aids in grocery shopping.
    #     At the core of this is a bracelet equipped with vibration feedback. By varying the intensity of the vibration, the app guides users to products in a supermarket.
    #     The app is designed to interface with the bracelet. The goal is to empower blind users with greater independence and ease in their supermarket hopping experiences.
